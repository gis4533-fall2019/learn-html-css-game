### Some Notes  
- Make sure to use the Github Desktop application available in APPS4U
- Make sure you use your personal storage on the W drive for this, or else the files in your repository won’t last beyond this session.
- Similarly, when you log off and then start a new virtual session, you’ll have to re-load your repository (that’s still on the W drive) into Github Desktop. [Some help for doing this.](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/adding-a-repository-from-your-local-computer-to-github-desktop)
