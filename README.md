Here is how you play:  
1. Go find an [avatar](https://techterms.com/definition/avatar)   
  - really any picture will do (make sure it's not [NSFW](https://www.lifewire.com/what-does-nsfw-mean-2483431))
2. Create a new branch
3. Put your image into one of the squares on the edge of the board and save your changes
4. Make a commit and submit a pull-request
5. Repeat steps 2-5, moving your game piece (avatar) one square closer to the tropy with each pull-request.

First one to make it to the trophy wins!
